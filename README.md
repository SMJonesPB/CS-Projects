# CS-Projects
These projects are the best ones I have done in my Computer Science classes. The original OS projects are in Java, and I did them in C# and Python to learn the languages. CS 120 is Computer Science 1 (Python), and CS 410 is Web Programming (HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and PHP).

Note: To run CS 120 Project 2, you need Jython Environment for Students (JES) because it has methods Python doesn't (i.e. distance()).
