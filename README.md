# CS-Projects
These projects are the best ones I did in my Computer Science classes. The original OS projects are in Java, and I remade them in Python to learn the language. CS 120 is Computer Science 1 (Python), CS 410 is Web Programming (HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and PHP), and OS is Operating Systems (C in a Linux virtual machine and Java).

Note: To run CS 120 Project 2, you need Jython Environment for Students (JES) because it has methods Python doesn't (i.e. distance() and getPixel()).
