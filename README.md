# CS-Projects
These projects are the best ones I have done in my Computer Science classes. The original OS projects are in Java, and I remade them in C# and Python to learn C# and Python. CS 120 is Computer Science 1 (Python), CS 410 is Web Programming (HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and PHP), and OS is Operating Systems (Linux virtual machine with C and Java). Make a pull request if you have a question. I will answer it in the Readme.

Note: To run CS 120 Project 2, you need Jython Environment for Students (JES) because it has methods Python doesn't (i.e. distance() and getPixel()).
